## 2024-05-17 - [Resolve Data-Fetching Waterfalls]
**Learning:** Sequential `fetch` calls in React components like detail pages (e.g., project details, associated lists) cause unnecessary waterfalls, artificially delaying Time to First Byte (TTFB). This architecture pattern of fetching independent entities synchronously represents a significant front-end bottleneck.
**Action:** Always utilize `Promise.all` to fetch and parse independent data queries concurrently (such as project details alongside lists) instead of waiting for each one sequentially, drastically reducing latency and load times.
