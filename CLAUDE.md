This file provides guidance for Claude Code when working with the opencitation project.

## Project Overview

**opencitation** is an open source citation machine designed to be ad-free and easy to use. The project aims to help users generate properly formatted citations for academic and professional work.

## Project Status

This is a new project in early development. The codebase is being built from scratch.

## Project Goals

- Provide a clean, ad-free citation generation experience
- Support multiple citation formats (MLA, APA, Chicago, Harvard, IEEE, etc.)
- Keep the interface simple and user-friendly
- Remain open source under the MIT License

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments only where logic isn't self-evident
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Architecture Principles
- Favor simplicity over complexity
- Avoid over-engineering; implement only what's needed
- Keep dependencies minimal

### Testing
- Write tests for citation formatting logic
- Ensure edge cases are covered (special characters, missing fields, etc.)

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Citation Style
1. Create the citation format template
2. Implement field mapping for the style
3. Add tests for the new format
4. Update documentation

### Running the Project
